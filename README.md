+ Custom UI videos (intro, round announcements, game end videos)
+ And a whole lot of new SFX to use in your dubs!

> ⚠ Clips in this pack contain strong language :)

## How to install
### From Steam Workshop (WTD only)
Since the introduction of "What The Dub?!" support of Steam Workshop, you can now subscribe to this clip pack - and Steam will take care of installing the clips for you!

Visit [pack's Workshop page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3050295462) to subscribe.

#### Benefits:
+ you can mix various packs in game, toggling them on and off
+ you can use Twitch chat integration to allow your chat to choose next clip

#### Some features will be *unavailable*:
+ custom sound effects are not supported by Workshop
+ custom UI videos and elements included in this pack (game intro, round intros, scoreboard) are not supported by Workshop

Therefore the *recommended* installation way is by using the *autoinstaller*. Read the next section for info.
### Automatic installation
Get the [auto-installer](https://github.com/g7eternal/wtd-forsen-pack/releases/latest/download/wtd-forsen-pack-auto.exe) - it will take care of finding your game and importing all the new clips! The whole process is just a few clicks!
#### Benefits of auto-installer:
+ downloads the latest version of the pack
+ automatically copies all the necessary files into your game folder
+ works with both What The Dub?! and RiffTrax games
+ allows you to select between normal and extended editions of the pack
+ allows you to leave the original video clips - effectively mixing custom and default clips for more content!
+ for streamers - has an option to remove the clips which may be considered as being too "edgy".

When running the installer, you may see a warning about running a file from untrusted source. Since the installer is not digitally signed, your PC will mark it as suspicious. That's completely fine, and you can proceed with installation:

6. All done! Start up the game to confirm: installation has been successful if new game intro is sus.

## How to remove pack
If you installed the pack using Workshop, you will have to unsubscribe - and Steam will automatically remove custom clips from your device.

Otherwise, the easiest way: delete the game, then reinstall it.

The proper way:

1. In your Steam library select **What the Dub?!** game, right-click -> _Manage_ -> _Browse local files_

2. Navigate to the folder you copied files into (same as step 3 of "install" section)

3. 
    a. **If you used an automatic installer:**
    * Delete the following folders: _UiVideo, TheEndClips, Subtitles, VideoClips_
    * Find the game in your Steam library, right-click -> *Properties* -> *Local Files* -> *Verify integrity of game files*
    * Steam will restore the original movie clips automatically
    
    b. **If you merged the pack with the original movie clips:**
    * do the same as above
    
    c. **If you replaced the original movie clips with the pack:**

    * Delete the following folders: _UiVideo, TheEndClips, Subtitles, VideoClips_
    * Move the original files from the _backup_ folder back to the _StreamingAssets_ folder

## Technical info
Info on how the game works was taken from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditAndChill/comments/mtacw3/lets_make_new_what_the_dub_vids_peepopog/).
- Basically you need some MP4 clips in _VideoClips_ folder, and SRT subtitles in _Subtitles_ folder for this to work. The name of MP4 should match with the name of SRT.
- _UiVideo_ folder contains all the intro/intermission/outro clips, simply replace them with any video of your choice.
- At the end of the game a random clip from _TheEndClips_ is chosen and played for the users. Add as many as you like.

## How to contribute
Any way you'd like to:
- if you know how to edit videos, please create a merge request with new files. In order to create a good clip, please follow the guidelines:
  - please keep the submissions "Forsen-related": do not send the clips which are unrelated to Forsen (i.e. other streamers unless Forsen is in the clip)
  - clips in _VideoClips_:
    - MP4 (AVC/AAC); 720p; any bitrate, any fps
    - normalize the volume (peaks at -12db)
    - cutting the audio of the \[insert your dub\] part of the clip is not necessary! (game automatically does that)
    - please try to keep the reasonable size (up to 20mb) and length (10±5 sec)
    - file name should match the pattern of: forsen-\[clip name\].mp4
    - *side note*: it is not necessary to mute the \[dubbed\] part when editing the clip, the game does that automatically for you. You could also _"abuse"_ this in order to make a dirty audio cut under the \[dub\].
  - subtitles in _Subtitles_:
    - generic .srt subtitle files
    - Do NOT use the following symbols mid-sentence: ```: [ ]``` (colon and square brackets)
      - these symbols are reserved for internal use: colon marks the speaker's name; square brackets mark the \[dubbed\] part
    - file name should match the pattern of: forsen-\[clip name\].srt (matching the name of corresponding clip)
  - videos in _UiVideos_:
    - MP4 (AVC/AAC); 1080p; any bitrate, any fps
    - name and length of a clip should match those of the original clip
  - videos in _TheEndClips_:
    - MP4 (AVC/AAC); 720p; any bitrate, any fps
    - please try to keep the reasonable size (up to 20mb) and length (<10 sec)
    - file names are not restricted
- if you don't (or can't) - do not worry! Just contact me:
    - pm me on discord (g7eternal#8037), [twitch](https://twitch.tv/g7eternal) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/g7_eternal)
- *Please note*: these guidelines were written for the clips intended to be used in *What The Dub?!* game. Although *RiffTrax* uses similar structure, which allows this custom pack to be used there too, some of the options above are inaccurate. When making content for *RiffTrax*, be aware of this fact.
